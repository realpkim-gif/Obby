The Timer System:
1. start_time = when this attempt began

Set when you press R to restart
Captures the absolute time from pygame.time.get_ticks()

2. current_time = pygame.time.get_ticks() - start_time

pygame.time.get_ticks() = total milliseconds since pygame started (never stops)
Subtracting start_time gives you time since this attempt started
Always starts at 0 for each new attempt

3. When you die:

deathtime = current_time saves how long you survived
